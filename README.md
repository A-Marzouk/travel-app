# Travel planning App Project

## Overview
This project works as a demo for Travel Planning Application using different external APIs.


## How it works?
The idea behind this app is very simple, the user enters the location and date of his coming trip and
the application gives him information about the location at this data. So that user can easily
plan his next travel.

## Technologies
Node.js | Express 

## Some added features:
- Add end date and display length of trip.
- Incorporate icons into forecast.
- Allow the user to add additional trips (this may take some heavy reworking, but is worth the challenge).
- Use of localStorage.
